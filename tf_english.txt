"Tip_3_19"				"As a Soldier, the Frying Pan does identical damage as the Shovel, but is a lot louder. Don't use it when you are trying to stay hidden, as the distinct sound will give your position away!"
"Tip_3_20"				"As a Soldier, the Righteous Bison can hit the same enemy multiple times, and will hit the most times on enemies who are moving away from the projectile. Use it to punish retreating enemies!"
"Tip_3_21"				"As a Soldier, hitting a teammate with the Disciplinary Action will increase both your and your ally's speed dramatically for a few seconds! Use it on slower classes like other Soldiers and Heavies in order to reach the front lines faster!"
"Tip_3_22"				"As a Soldier, use %attack2% when wielding the Cow Mangler 5000 to fire a charged shot, dealing extra damage and setting the enemy briefly on fire. Be careful! A charged shot entirely depletes the Cow Mangler 5000's ammunition."

"Tip_4_13"				"As a Demoman, when using the Chargin' Targe you can't change direction during a charge. Try to line charges up with where an enemy will be rather than where an enemy is."

"Tip_4_15"				"As a Demoman, your Bottle has no negative attributes when compared to the health reduction penalty of the Eyelander. Use your Bottle if survival is a priority."
"Tip_4_16"				"As a Demoman, collect heads by killing enemies with the Eyelander.  Each head increases your maximum health and also gives you a speed boost!"
"Tip_4_17"				"As a Demoman, the only way to recharge your Ullapool Caber is to visit a resupply locker. Make every hit with it count!"
"Tip_4_18"				"As a Demoman, when using the Scottish Resistance remember that you can see your Stickybombs through walls and floors and can detonate them from any range. Use this to your advantage."

"Tip_4_20"				"As a Demoman, use the Loch-n-Load to inflict additional damage against slower moving classes and buildings. Aim carefully however! You only have three shots before you must reload, and you will only inflict damage on a direct hit."
"Tip_4_21"				"As a Demoman, use the Ullapool Caber when surrounded by enemies. The resulting explosion will inflict heavy damage on all nearby opponents."
"Tip_4_22"				"As a Demoman, use the Claidheamh Mòr to maximize the effectiveness of your Chargin' Targe. You won't inflict critical hits or collect heads, but the extra duration of your charge will allow you to cover more distance, or make a quick escape!"
"Tip_4_23"				"As a Demoman, if you're paired with a Medic, take advantage of safe opportunities to damage yourself in order to build an ÜberCharge faster."
"Tip_4_24"				"As a Demoman, your Eyelander will collect the stored heads from a slain enemy Demoman."
"Tip_4_25"				"As a Demoman, a successful taunt kill with the Half-Zatoichi will allow you to sheath the sword."

"Tip_4_30"				"As a Demoman, the Persian Persuader converts all ammo pickups into health packs, preventing you from acquiring ammo for your primary and secondary weapons.  Make every shot count!"
